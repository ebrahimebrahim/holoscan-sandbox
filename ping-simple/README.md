This is a copy of [this example](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/examples/ping_simple.html) with some modifications.
It is meant to be built directly on an NVIDIA AGX devkit, as a demo of a standalone C++ application that can be built on the device.
It is assumed that the device has the holoscan SDK deb pacakage installed, i.e. at `/opt/nvidia/holoscan`.
