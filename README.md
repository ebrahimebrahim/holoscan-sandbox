# holoscan-sandbox

This repository is a pile of experiments and examples in holoscan-sdk as I learn how it works.

It's not very organized, but if I ever need to look at this again then here is a somewhat sensible order in which to look at the subprojects:
- ping-simple
- video-replayer
- custom-operator-viz
- acquisition-example (this one is not so much about holoscan as it is about a specific camera sensor that I am working with)
